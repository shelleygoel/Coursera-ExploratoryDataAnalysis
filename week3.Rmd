Clustering organizes things that are close into groups.

## Hierarhical Clustering
Simple and intuitive technique to group and visualize 
multi-dimensional data. 


**Method**

1) Find two things which are closest.
2) Merge them together to form a new super point. This
super point now represents the two points. 
4) Find next two closest points and merge them together to 
a super point


**Requires**   

* Distance Metric  
* Merging approach


**Output**

- A tree/dendogram showing how data points are close to eachother.


**Distance metric examples**

- Euclidean distance (continuous)
- Correlation distance (continous)
- Manhattan distance (binary)

### Example

```{r example}
set.seed()
```
